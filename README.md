Tool for creating Commodore 1541 Floppy disk images in D64, G64 or D71 format with custom sector interleaving etc. Also supports extended tracks 35-40 using either SPEED DOS or DOLPHIN DOS BAM-formatting.

Originally written by JackAsser, with improvements and fixes by Krill and some more improvements by Claus.

The folder test_cc1541 contains a simple test suite that will call a cc1541 binary with different commandlines and examine the resulting image file.

The program is under the MIT license, please refer to the cc1541 source file for further information.
