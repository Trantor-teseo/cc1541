== Name

cc1541 - A tool for creating Commodore 1541 Floppy disk images
in D64, D71 or D81 format with custom sector interleaving etc.
Also supports extended tracks 35-40 using either SPEED DOS or
DOLPHIN DOS BAM-formatting.

== Synopsis

*cc1541* [_-niwfoVTPOlBMdtuxFsSeErbc45gqvh_] image.[_d64|d71|d81_]

== Options

*-n diskname*::
  Disk name, default='DEFAULT'.

*-i id*::
  Disk ID, default='LODIS'.

*-w localname*::
  Write local file to disk, if filename is not set then the local
name is used.  After file written, the filename is unset.

*-f filename*::
  Use filename as name when writing next file, use prefix _#_ to
include arbitrary PETSCII characters (e.g. -f "START#a0,8,1").

*-o*::
  Do not overwrite if file with same name exists already.

*-V*::
  Do not modify image unless it is in valid CBM DOS format.

*-T filetype*::
  Filetype for next file, allowed parameters are PRG, SEQ, USR, REL
and DEL. For DEL, the input file is ignored.  Default is PRG.

*-P*::
  Set write protect flag for next file.

*-O*::
  Set open flag for next file.

*-l filename*::
  Write loop file (an additional dir entry) to existing file to disk,
set filename with -f.

*-B numblocks*::
  Write the given value as file size in blocks to the directory for
the next file.

*-M numchars*::
  Hash computation maximum filename length, this must match loader
option FILENAME_MAXLENGTH in the Krill loader.  If this switch is
set, a check for hash collision is performed.

*-d track*::
  Maintain a shadow directory (copy of the actual directory without a
valid BAM).

*-t*::
  Use dirtrack to also store files (makes -x useless) (default no).

*-u numblocks*::
  When using -t, amount of dir blocks to leave free (default=2).

*-x*::
  Don't split files over dirtrack hole (default split files).

*-F*::
  Next file first sector on a new track (default=3).  Any negative
value assumes aligned tracks and uses current sector + interleave.
After each file, the value falls back to the default.  Not applicable
for D81.

*-S value*::
  Default sector interleave, default=10.  At track end, reduces this
by 1 to accomodate large tail gap.  If negative, no special treatment
of tail gap.  Not applicable for D81.

*-s value*::
  Next file sector interleave, valid after each file.  At track end,
reduces this by 1 to accomodate large tail gap.  If negative, no
special treatment of tail gap.  The interleave value falls back to
the default value set by -S after the first sector of the next file.
Not applicable for D81.

*-e*::
  Start next file on an empty track (default start sector is current
sector plus interleave).

*-E*::
  Try to fit file on a single track.

*-r track*::
  Restrict next file blocks to the specified track or higher.

*-b sector*::
  Set next file beginning sector to the specified value.  Not
applicable for D81.

*-c*::
  Save next file cluster-optimized (d71 only).

*-4*::
  Use tracks 35-40 with SPEED DOS BAM formatting.

*-5*::
  Use tracks 35-40 with DOLPHIN DOS BAM formatting.

*-g filename*::
  Write additional g64 output file with given name.

*-q*::
  Be quiet.

*-v*::
  Be verbose.

*-h*::
  Print commandline help.

== Exit status

*0*::
  Success.

*-1*::
  Failure.
